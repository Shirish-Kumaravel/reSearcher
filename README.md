# reSearcher
reSearcher is a research practice management portal. It simplifies the tedious task of managing projects for students and professors by providing an all-in-one overview of projects. Students can use the portal to find projects that they want to enrol in and professors they would like to work with. Professors can use the portal to increase awareness about their fields of study, as well as manage the students assigned to projects.

## Features
* View professors' areas of interest and their ongoing and completed projects.
* Find available projects relating to your preferred area of study.
* Enrol and unenrol students into projects.
* View details about students' involvement in various projects.

## Additional Details
We have utilized a React.js frontend. We also used a Node.js backend with Express.js. Data is stored on an SQL database, which also processes the queries. We have applied concepts such as database normalization to ensure our database schema is non-redundant and easy to work with.
